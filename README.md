# Purpose
In addition to advertising my business, this website collected registration information from users and wrote it to a database, using PHP MySQL.  The HTML code was mostly generated in PHP.  JavaScript detects user screen size and adjusts the website accordingly.  Design is not my strong suit, but I did design the website in Adobe Creative Suite as well as write the code.  The site was from 2012-2013 and a fully functioning archive is available at http://douglasmichaelsinger.com/singteam.
