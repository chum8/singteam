Each SingTeam<span class="super_script">TM</span> is under the oversight of a licensed instructor, who helps form the team and trains the students in musicianship and leadership.  But the majority of planning, organizing, and operation of each team is done by the students themselves.  They name their team, design costumes, choreograph dance routines, sell team sponsorships among community businesses, foster team spirit, and exercise creativity and ingenuity in developing a team who seeks to win the SingTeam<span class="super_script">TM</span> championship.<br/><br/>

No other organization empowers students to use their own talents and gifts in such a concrete way.  But there's more.  STA<span class="super_script">TM</span> is also the only musical opportunity of its kind that places primary emphasis on expressive communication and improvisation, musical arts that were once central to music-making and have suffered universal neglect.  STA<span class="super_script">TM</span> uses fine music that is popular in intent - songs that are intellectually stimulating, yet expressive and exciting.   <br/><br/>

No one should miss this exciting new opportunity to develop their voice and put their creative gifts to use!<br/><br/>
